    "aboutUs__text-page":"Welcome to Sushi Dream! We are a team of sushi enthusiasts who dream of providing you with the most delicious sushi and unforgettable culinary experiences. Our story begins on the streets of two great cities — London and Kyiv .London has always been a cultural and culinary hub, where different tastes and traditions converge. It was here, on Cherry Blossom Street, known for its elegance, that our founder, Hiroshi Tanaka, decided to start his sushi business. His deep passion for gastronomy and his mastery in preparing fish dishes became the foundation for creating Sushi Dream. Thanks to Hiroshi and his unparalleled sushi creations, Cherry Blossom Street quickly became a destination where people from all over the city flocked to indulge in these incredible flavors.At the same time, on Khreshchatyk Street in Kyiv, a young and vibrant culinary scene was gaining momentum. Captivated by this movement, our head chef, Alexander Ivanov, decided to create his own sushi restaurant. With his unique recipes and bold flavor combinations, Alexander quickly gained popularity among fans of Japanese cuisine. The restaurant on Khreshchatyk Street became a cultural hotspot where food lovers gathered.Over time, Hiroshi and Alexander realized that both cities were teeming with sushi lovers who sought authentic flavors and unforgettable experiences. Their paths crossed at an international culinary exhibition, where they saw a shared dream — to create a sushi restaurant chain that would blend Eastern culinary traditions with modern trends.And so, Sushi Dream was born! Our goal is to surprise you with unparalleled flavors and original ingredient combinations. Our chefs skillfully combine the freshness of natural ingredients with the art of creating true culinary masterpieces that will astonish and captivate you.We invite you to join our family and embark on a journey with us into the world of extraordinary sushi experiences.",
